# Circular Motion
Circular motion is a type of motion in which an object moves in a circle. It can be uniform circular motion, where the object moves at a constant speed, or non-uniform circular motion, where the speed of the object changes as it moves around the circle. Circular motion is characterized by the centripetal acceleration that keeps the object moving in a circular path.

## Equations
The equations of motion for circular motion are as follows:
* The angular velocity of the object is given by:
  $\omega = \frac{v}{r}$
* The tangential velocity of the object is given by:
  $v = r \omega$
* The centripetal acceleration of the object is given by:
  $a_c = r \omega^2$
* The centripetal force required to keep the object moving in a circle is given by:
  $F_c = m a_c = m r \omega^2$
* The period of the motion is given by:
  $T = \frac{2\pi r}{v} = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}$
* The frequency of the motion is given by:
  $f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{\omega}{2\pi}$
* The angular frequency of the motion is given by:
  $\omega = 2\pi f$
* The centripetal acceleration can also be expressed as:
  $a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}$
* The centripetal force can also be expressed as:
  $F_c = \frac{m v^2}{r}$
* The time taken to reach the maximum velocity is given by:
  $t_{\text{max velocity}} = \frac{\pi}{2\omega}$
* The time taken to reach the equilibrium position is given by:
  $t_{\text{equilibrium}} = \frac{\pi}{\omega}$
* The time taken to reach the maximum acceleration is given by:
  $t_{\text{max acceleration}} = \frac{\pi}{4\omega}$
* The velocity of the object at any time \(t\) is given by:
  $v = \sqrt{v_t^2 + v_r^2}$
