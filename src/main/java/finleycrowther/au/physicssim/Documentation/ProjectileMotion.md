# Projectile Motion
Projectile motion is a form of motion experienced by an object or particle (a projectile) that is thrown near the Earth's surface and moves along a curved path under the action of gravity only. The only force of significance that acts on the object is gravity, which acts downward to cause a downward acceleration. Because of the downward acceleration, the vertical component of the projectile's velocity decreases as the projectile rises and increases as the projectile falls. The horizontal component of the projectile's velocity remains constant throughout the flight. The path that the object follows is called its trajectory. The trajectory of a projectile is parabolic.

## Equations
The equations of motion for a projectile are as follows:
* The horizontal component of the velocity is given by:
  $v_x = v_0 \cos(\theta)$
* The vertical component of the velocity is given by:
  $v_y = v_0 \sin(\theta) - gt$
* The horizontal position of the projectile is given by:
  $x = v_0 t \cos(\theta)$
* The vertical position of the projectile is given by:
  $y = v_0 t \sin(\theta) - \frac{1}{2}gt^2$
* The time of flight is given by:
  $t = \frac{2v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}$
* The range of the projectile is given by:
  $R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}$
* The maximum height of the projectile is given by:
  $H = \frac{v_0^2 \sin^2(\theta)}{2g}$
* The time taken to reach the maximum height is given by:
  $t_{\text{max}} = \frac{v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}$
* The time taken to reach the ground is given by:
  $t_{\text{ground}} = \frac{2v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}$
* The velocity of the projectile at any time \(t\) is given by:
  $v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}$
