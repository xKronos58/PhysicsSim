# Simple Harmonic Motion
Simple harmonic motion is a type of periodic motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement. It can serve as a mathematical model of a variety of motions, such as the oscillation of a spring or a pendulum. The motion is sinusoidal in time and demonstrates a characteristic sinusoidal oscillation.

## Equations
The equations of motion for simple harmonic motion are as follows:
* The displacement of the object is given by:
  $x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi)$
* The velocity of the object is given by:
  $v(t) = -A \omega \sin(\omega t + \phi)$
* The acceleration of the object is given by:
  $a(t) = -A \omega^2 \cos(\omega t + \phi)$
* The period of the motion is given by:
  $T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}$
* The frequency of the motion is given by:
  $f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{\omega}{2\pi}$
* The angular frequency of the motion is given by:
  $\omega = 2\pi f$
* The amplitude of the motion is given by:
  $A = \sqrt{x_{\text{max}}^2 + x_{\text{min}}^2}$
* The phase constant of the motion is given by:
  $\phi = \arctan\left(\frac{x_{\text{max}}}{x_{\text{min}}}\right)$
* The maximum velocity of the object is given by:
  $v_{\text{max}} = A \omega$
* The maximum acceleration of the object is given by:
  $a_{\text{max}} = A \omega^2$
* The energy of the object is given by:
  $E = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \frac{1}{2} k A^2$
* The power of the object is given by:
  $P = F v = k A \omega^2 \sin(\omega t + \phi)$
* The phase constant of the motion is given by:
  $\phi = \arctan\left(\frac{v_{\text{max}}}{a_{\text{max}}}\right)$
* The time taken to reach the maximum displacement is given by:
  $t_{\text{max}} = \frac{\pi}{2\omega}$
* The time taken to reach the equilibrium position is given by:
  $t_{\text{equilibrium}} = \frac{\pi}{\omega}$
* The time taken to reach the maximum velocity is given by:
  $t_{\text{max velocity}} = \frac{\pi}{4\omega}$
