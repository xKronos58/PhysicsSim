# Gravitational Field 
The gravitational field simulation allows the user to simulate the motion of a projectile in a gravitational field. The user can set the initial velocity and angle of the projectile, as well as the strength of the gravitational field. The simulation will then show the path of the projectile as it moves through the field, taking into account the effects of gravity on its motion.

## Equations
The equations of motion for a projectile in a gravitational field are as follows:
* The horizontal component of the velocity is given by:
  $v_x = v_0 \cos(\theta)$
* The vertical component of the velocity is given by:
  $v_y = v_0 \sin(\theta) - gt$
* The horizontal position of the projectile is given by:
  $x = v_0 t \cos(\theta)$
* The vertical position of the projectile is given by:
  $y = v_0 t \sin(\theta) - \frac{1}{2}gt^2$
* The time of flight is given by:
  $t = \frac{2v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}$
* The range of the projectile is given by:
  $R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}$
* The maximum height of the projectile is given by:
  $H = \frac{v_0^2 \sin^2(\theta)}{2g}$
* The time taken to reach the maximum height is given by:
  $t_{\text{max}} = \frac{v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}$
* The time taken to reach the ground is given by:
  $t_{\text{ground}} = \frac{2v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}$
* The velocity of the projectile at any time \(t\) is given by:
  $v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}$
* The acceleration of the projectile is given by:
  $a = \sqrt{a_x^2 + a_y^2}$
* The horizontal component of the acceleration is given by:
  $a_x = 0$
* The vertical component of the acceleration is given by:
  $a_y = -g$
* The force acting on the projectile is given by:
  $F = m \cdot a$
